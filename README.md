The goal of this study is to create a business plan that will persuade investors that launching a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a viable option. We use publicly available data from the NYC CitiBike program archives and Tableau to build visualizations throughout the process.

We use our data knowledge and critical thinking skills to develop a story that can be presented to investors, despite the fact that the data is based on activities that occurred in New York City, which is significantly different from Des Moine

For our presentation, we've decided to base our study on data from August 2019. It is considered that during the summer months, there is higher traffic or usage than during other times of the year when weather can affect activities.

* Almost all of the journeys (99%) took less than 60 minutes, with 49% taking less than 10 minutes.

* Male riders make up 65 percent of the bike sharing population, with female riders accounting for 25% of the population and unknown riders accounting for 10%.

* The majority of rides occur during commuting hours of 8-9 a.m. and 5-7 p.m. on weekdays (M-F). It's safe to assume that bike sharing is the favored mode of transportation to and from work.

* Male commuters are more likely to use the bike sharing program to get to and from work, as well as on weekends.

* Subscribers used the service the most on Thursday, while non-subscribers used it the most on Saturday.



# Summary

## We can describe the following actions that occurred in New York City based on the visuals above:

* The majority of the usage came from stalls in densely populated corporate locations like Midtown and Downtown.
* The principal user is the subscriber.
* The majority of the journeys were < 10 minutes long.


In conclusion, launching a bike share program in Des Moines, Iowa, could be a profitable economic endeavor if it is implemented in densely populated regions where mass transportation is heavily used and parking is scarce. However, in order to create a compelling case to support this recommendation, we would need to analyze additional data by adding:

* To determine the distance traveled, create a visualization that maps out usage from the beginning to the conclusion. Where do users begin their journey and why? Are they completing their commute on a bike after taking the bus or train?
* Add a visualization to investigate activity by age group, as well as demographic data to pinpoint regions where bikeshares are most likely to be used (i.e. census data).

Additional

* Examine data from other cities to see if they're a better match for Des Moines' population, size, and traffic pattern. (Limiting our research to New York City activities is not a fair comparison because New York City has a big commuter population as well as increased tourist traffic.)
* Create a visualization for each month of the year to see if weather has an impact on consumption.
